swing trading using deep reinforcement learning. The deep deterministic policy gradient-based neural network model trains to choose an action to sell, buy, or hold the stocks to maximize the gain in asset value. The paper also acknowledges the need for a system that predicts the trend in stock value to work along with the reinforcement learning algorithm. We implement a sentiment analysis model using a recurrent convolutional neural network to predict the stock trend from the financial news. The objective of this paper is not to build a better trading bot, but to prove that reinforcement learning is capable of learning the tricks of stock trading.","homepage":"","default_branch":"master","created_at":"2017-02-06T05:41:32Z","pushed_at":"2017-04-27T18:54:32Z","updated_at":"2020-06-28T03:49:29Z","html_url":"https://github.com/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock","clone_url":"https://github.com/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock.git","git_url":"git://github.com/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock.git","ssh_url":"git@github.com:BangaloreSharks/SharkStock.git","svn_url":"https://github.com/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock","language":"Python","fork":false,"forks_count":27,"open_issues_count":0,"stargazers_count":45,"watchers_count":45,"size":133496,"permissions":{"admin":false,"pull":true,"push":false},"topics":["convolutional-neural-networks","deep-reinforcement-learning","policy-gradient","recurrent-neural-networks","sentiment-classification","stock-market","trading-bot"],"archived":false,"disabled":false,"private":false,"has_issues":true,"has_wiki":true,"has_pages":false,"has_projects":true,"has_downloads":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/{archive_format}{/ref}","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/assignees{/user}","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/git/blobs{/sha}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/branches{/branch}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/collaborators{/collaborator}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/comments{/number}","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/commits{/sha}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/compare/{base}...{head}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/contents/{+path}","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/contributors","deployments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/deployments","downloads_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/downloads","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/events","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/forks","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/git/commits{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/git/refs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/git/tags{/sha}","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/hooks","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/issues/comments{/number}","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/issues/events{/number}","issues_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/issues{/number}","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/keys{/key_id}","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/labels{/name}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/languages","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/merges","milestones_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/milestones{/number}","notifications_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/notifications{?since,all,participating}","pulls_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/pulls{/number}","releases_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/releases{/id}","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/stargazers","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/statuses/{sha}","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/subscription","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/tags","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/git/trees{/sha}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BangaloreSharks/SharkStock/teams"},{"id":121395901,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjEzOTU5MDE=","owner":{"login":"rena2damas","id":16232513,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjMyNTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/16232513?v=4","html_url":"https://github.com/rena2damas","gravatar_id":"","type":"User","site_admin":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/users/rena2damas","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rena2damas/events{/privacy}","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rena2damas/following{/other_user}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rena2damas/followers","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rena2damas/gists{/gist_id}","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rena2damas/orgs","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rena2damas/received_events","rep
